V1.1
- Removed the JS code department look up on Zendesk as this is now being done within the bot via Webhook

V1.2
- Moved Widget closer to bottom right (25px from both borders)
- After having navigated three pages, the Widget will open itself. Behaviour resets after the 10th visit
- Bot never opens itself otherwise, but the widget icon is always visible
- Removed agent availability check via JavaScript, as this is now done in the bot via Webhook

V1.3
- Moved Widget in the background to prevent overlay with the cookies banner (zIndex was changed from 10030 to 19)
- Changed the icon of the chat, to match the chatbot avatar
- Changed the automatic opening behaviour. The bot will always stay closed, unless (A) the visitor has browsed three webpages or (B) the visitor has navigated 21 more pages since A.
